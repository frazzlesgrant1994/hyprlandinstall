# What is Hyprland <a name="about">

<br>

Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

It supports multiple layouts, fancy effects, has a very flexible IPC model allowing for a lot of customization, a powerful plugin system and more.

Hyprland is still in pretty early development compared to some other Wayland compositors.

Although Hyprland is pretty stable, it may have some bugs.
